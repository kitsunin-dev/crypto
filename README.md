# Cryptographer (ver. 0.1)
This is a desktop application for encrypting messages with different ciphers made with Qt/C++.
So far, the following ciphers have been implemented in the application:
1. Atbash
2. Caesar
3. Playfair
4. Vig√®nere

Right now, only the encryption function is available. Decryption will be added later.
